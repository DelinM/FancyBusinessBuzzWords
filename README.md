<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I am working in an engineering consulting firm. Every month I have to attend numerous meetings. Some meetings are internal project design meetings, peer to peer discussion meetings, project progress discussion meetings, CEO motivational speeches, People Manager salary discussion meetings… <br /><br />

In almost every meeting, I usually hear one or two words that I don’t necessarily know the meaning, but as soon as they are being said, I feel pumped/motivated/triggered, that’s when I grab my notebook and quickly write them down so that I will remember them, and hopefully I will use them myself one day.<br /><br />

These words are business buzzwords. I notice that when the buzzwords are said in client meetings, even the most unsatisfied clients would show their genuine Duchenne smiles. I observe that when the buzzwords are said by a chief of staff in company’s performance meeting, all the executive staff would coherently nod showing unbreakable determination and strength. I notice that when people managers uses multiple buzzwords in his/her motivational speeches, I would work until 2:30 am in the morning without any hesitation and refuse a bonus the next day.<br /><br />

This repository includes all the business buzz words I hear in my lifetime. I hope you would enjoy them and maybe use them in your interviews, client meetings, motivational speeches, and/or business negotiations. If one day I walk on the street hearing an stranger saying the buzzwords I collected in my repository, I believe that that stranger might be you, I would come in front of you and say hi!<br /><br />
